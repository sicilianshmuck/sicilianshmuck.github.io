<br>
eventually hopefully soon like before i go on vacation on the 18th i will have lauched version 2 of alvar clicker. why you might ask that this is such a huge jump is that it will be a entire remodel of the website there will be seperate units with their own costs show how much they cost and would not be a rip off of cookie clicker. this will in fact to start will be harder then cookie clicker. i will also install a self uniting system where i can make it increase of decrease on what ever i feel i could make it the same as cookie clicker (1.15) or i could make it like 1.46 or something random. i also could change it by unit like one is 1.17 and another 1.43 another 1.24 and so on. the problem is that if i dont do it before my vacation i may not work on it until school starts up again in 3 months so yeah. hope you enjoy the game. i think its a fun one and to click on the picture of alvar and the chipmunks. also for people that want there own clicker game i could create one for you for a wallet refil just sayin. i liked the 19:20s becase 20s were all over for 20 year olds 20 20 20. puttin it out there
<br>
<br>
<br>
version 1.0785 10/21/22
<br>
<br>
public anouncement i am aware that pretty much no one is really playing this game but if you are by the end of the year i will launch version 2.0!! i kno right!?! it is taking a lot long to keep and maintain this game so yeah. version 2 will have seperate units do seperate things with a more organized manner unlitmited units and it will tell you how much each unit costs. also if you ever see alvar in school tell him he looks like alvin from alvin and the chipmunks.
<br>
<br>
<br>
version 1.2308 10/24/22 
<br>
<br>
new anouncement. i fixed more of the bugs. and btw the reason this is on a new webpage is that the school decided they hate kids creativity and want to crush kids dreams. also they are bent on ruining fun like this. so yeah. i have another announcement the new realease date for the scheduled version 2.0 update is on 11/02/22. why is that i did not feel like waiting and this game needed an update. the color scheme will be different i will be lazy and not spend to much time on it. so if you think of a good color for it just tell me in person about the game and who ever suggests the best color can have their name on the credits. in memoriam of the website alvar clicker R.I.P ðŸ˜µðŸ¤§ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜£ 06.02.2022-10.24.2022

version 1.2456 10/25/22 
<br>
<br>
dang they blocked learning with reece (search up sad violin and click on first link). why? this website only lasted a day but it was fun. in memory of the website learning with reece R.I.P. 10.24.2022-10.25.2022
<br>
<br>
<br>
version 1.3000 10/25/22
<br>
<br>
i had another website but that was instablocked. funny the website was if-school-block-dis-schools-a-waste-of-life hopefully this new one will last alot longer.
<br>
<br>
<br>
version 1.3076 10/25/22
<br>
<br>
i just do this for fun and no disrect to alvar. he told me he forgot about the game and found it stupid so that by the law of myself means that he signed and is ok with this game. he finds it funny tho. i was working on finishing the update for version 2.0 and something bugged and messed up the game completely beyond repair. so i just remake it by working for a while and it is almost fully repaired. i can have it published by tommorow but because it is an entire new code and script this one will be wiped. but because i spent avery long time on this game so i will have this published on replit as the original alvarclicker once v2 starts up. there is a lot of work to do to get it perfect or honeslty good so there will be a couple problems with the game. here is the list. 
<br>
there is a semi circle by the image
<br>
the picture does not bounce when it is clicked
<br>
add multiplicative unit increase (up by 15 % each time yo buy it)
<br>
and last but definetly not least i forgot how to add new units
<br>
<br>
once i can these will get it done i will also plz donate. now were back with our sponser raid shadow legends! raid shadow legends is a free to play online multiplayer mobile game. if you use my code GETALIFE you can get this -1000000  coins. jk if you have any good ideas let me know will put you in credits once i figure out how to add new page. will also add a graveyard for the previous websites.

version 1.4863 10/25/2022 (at like 10 at night)
<br>
<br>
i added the 10 at night to show that i actually work on this. so another update? yeah i figured out how to add more pages to this so it is now more organized. i know that the links are a bit boring but i still have to add stuff and create a whole new js. for each link. honestly until i figure the most important thing in v2 which is either add new units or add a muliplicative unit increase(btw that is where it goes up by say 15 percent which is what i am going to try to do.) i am just going to make the game look better. also i want to try to add better fonts. remember v2 update 11/01/2022 dont miss it. hope this webpage lasts longer then the last two. the reason the school is blocking this game i dont know but i do know that this is actually quite annoying to have to keep making new sites so hopefully they stop blocking the websites or at least not often and make the websites last longer. i actually worked on this game and even though it is very bad i spent time on it so i am constantly updating this website and game currently I am focused on v2 of the game but i still try and fix the current one. considering i am doing this for fun and have never coded before i'd say its pretty good so dont trash it and especially more important than anything i just said DO NOT TELL OR SHOW OR MAKE IN ANY WAY FOUND BY THE TEACHERS AS IN DONT PLAY WHEN A TEACHER HAS GOGARDIAN ON PLZ IT MAKES MORE WORK ON ME PLAY DURING WIN OR LUNCH OR SOMETHING.
